            <h1><center>Microclimatic Changes Related to Bus Traffic</center></h1>
            <p>Rio de Janeiro is a unique city due to its geography, diversity and public transportation system. 
			It is a coastal city with many landforms as massive, bays, islands, reefs, lagoons, mountains, rivers and hills. 
			With more than 12 million residents, Rio de Janeiro is the second most populous metropolitan area in Brazil. 
			With high-density occupancy (the hills aren't suitable to build houses) and very few highways crossing the city, most Rio street pass through valleys or the coast, leaving only a few route options for cars and buses. In addition, buses are Rio's main public transport. There is almost 8000 buses running daily through the city. Some streets are so busy that one bus passes by every 20 seconds.</p>
			<p>This leads to big pollution problems. The buses runs on diesel fuel, which is high pollutant. Carbon monoxide pollution has been linked to increased health problems. 
			People who live close to intense bus traffic areas are much more susceptible to develop respiratory issues than who live far from those areas.</p>
			<p>This study correlates the impact of heavy bus traffic in DataCanvas sensors surrounding microclimate. 
			Rio's bus GPS data stream is provided by municipality and is currently being stored by Rio Bus Project using Google Big Query and App Engine infrastructure.
			Hundreds of millions bus data records was analysed and summarized to 1 hour time slice. 
			After that, bus data was cross joined with DataCanvas sensor's data in search of correlation between close bus traffic and air pollution.
			The correlation between air pollution and bus traffic are presented in 2 types of graphics. 
			One with all data series graph display, from both bus and DataCanvas sensor data, dynamically hiding chosen series for better visualization.
			The second graphic is a map evidencing two major things: the high traffic indeed impact badly the street microclimate, and how natural climatic dynamics affects the environmental cleansing of air pollution.</p>
			<p>Two special weeks were chosen for this study. One extremely hot week between 25/01/2015 and 31/01/2015, with heavy rains at 18:00. This week has ideal climate dynamics where air pollutants natural transportation to high layers of the atmosphere, decreasing city pollution.
			The other is a "cool" summer week in Rio between 07/03/2015 and 13/03/2015, with natural inversion phenomenon. When it happens, the air pollutants become trapped between a low cool atmospheric layer and a high hot atmospheric layer. In this scenario, the whole city is affected with decreased pollution dispersion.</p>
			<p>Sensors located in a 50m radius from high bus traffic areas presented not only more permanent high air pollution rates, but also the difference between the lowest day value and its peak was much higher than sensors far from high bus traffic areas, even with ideal climatic dynamics playing on.
			This is the ultimate goal of this study: show scientific evidence that Rio de Janeiro's public mass transit plan relying mostly on bus commute is a mistake because the health of people who live or work in high bus traffic areas are in danger.</p>
			<p>The microclimatic changes related to bus traffic are real and proven.
